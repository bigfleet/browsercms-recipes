5. Description

getspent,  getspname,  fgetspent and sgetspent each return
a structure Shadow::Passwd::Entry.    getspent returns the
next entry from the file,   and fgetspent returns the next
entry from the given stream. sgetspent returns a structure
Shadow::Passwd::Entry using the provided string as input.
getspnam searches from the current position in the file for
an entry matching name.
if you get EOF from each operation, you will get nil.

setspent and endspent may be used to begin and end, respe-
ctively, access to the shadow password file.

lckpwdf(lock) and ulckpwdf(unlock) methods should be used
to insure exclusive access to the /etc/shadow file.
when either method fail, Exception Shadow::FileLock is raised.
if you use lock as the iterator, unlock is automatically called
when you exit the iterator block.
